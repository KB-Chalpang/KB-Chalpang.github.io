I am a PhD student specializing in developing statistical methods for survey data often used in ecology and economics. My research focuses on probabilistic modeling and spatial statistics to better understand complex systems. I am particularly interested in applying Bayesian inference and stochastic processes to analyze environmental and economic data.

I am currently developing probabilistic models for presence-only data, designed to answer questions about the magnitude and effect of environmental variables.

#Thanks for visiting my website! I am a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), UK. I am also affiliated to the Royal #Botanical Gardens (KEW).
